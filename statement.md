# My First Playground!

This Java template is my first one uploaded on tech.io. It doesn't even work.

```java runnable
// { autofold
public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {
// }

String name = "Viewer!";
int j = 1;
if(j == 1){
System.out.println("Hello " + name);
}

else if(j == 2){
System.out.println("Goodbye " + name);
}
if(j == 1){
j = j + 1;
}
else if(j == 2){
j= j-1;
}
}
}
//{ autofold
//}
```

# Why do I have this space?

This space is useless to me therefore I will waste it by doing so.
